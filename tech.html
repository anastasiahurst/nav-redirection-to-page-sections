            <header><h2>Python</h2></header>
            <div>
                <p>Developed by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s, the multi-purpose high-level Python has grown extremely fast over the years to become one of the most popular programming languages today.</p>
                <p>And the number one reason for Python's popularity is its beginner-friendliness, which allows anyone, even individuals with no programming background, to pick up Python and start creating simple programs.</p>
                <p>But that's not all. It also offers an exceptionally vast collection of packages and libraries that can play a key role in reducing the ETA for your projects, along with a strong community of like-minded developers that is eager to help.</p>
                <p>Although Python can be used to build pretty much anything, it really shines when it comes to working on technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics. Python also proves to be useful for web development, creating enterprise applications, and GUIs for applications.</p>

        <div class="main-section" id="JavaScript">
            <header><H2>JavaScript</H2></header>
            <div>
                <p>JavaScript was one of the key programming languages alongside HTML and CSS that helped build the internet. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Netscape, the company that released the famous Netscape Navigator browser, to eliminate the crudeness of static web pages and add a pinch of dynamic behavior to them.</p>
                <p>Today, JavaScript has become a high-level multi-paradigm programming language that serves as the world's top frontend programming language for the web, handling all the interactions offered by the webpages, such as pop-ups, alerts, events, and many more like them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is the perfect option if you want your app to run across a range of devices, such as smartphones, cloud, containers, micro-controllers, and on hundreds of browsers. For the server-side workloads, there's Node.js, a proven JavaScript runtime that is being used by thousands of companies today.</p>

        <div class="main-section" id="Java">
            <header><H2>Java</H2></header>
            <div>
                <p>Java has remained the de-facto programming language for building enterprise-grade applications for more than 20 years now. Created by Sun Microsystems’ James Gosling in 1995, the object-oriented programming language Java has been serving as a secure, reliable, and scalable tool for developers ever since.Some of the features offered by Java that make it more preferable than several other programming languages are its garbage collection capabilities, backward compatibility, platform independence via JVM, portability, and high performance. Java’s popularity can be seen clearly among the Fortune 500 members as 90% of them use Java to manage their business efficiently.</p>
                <p>Apart from being used to develop robust business applications, Java has also been used extensively in Android, making it a prerequisite for Android developers. Java also allows developers to create apps for a range of industries, such as banking, electronic trading, e-commerce, as well as apps for distributed computing.</p>

        <div class="main-section" id="R">
            <header><H2>R</H2></header>
            <div>
                <p>If you do any sort of data analysis or work on Machine Learning projects, the chances are that you may have heard about R. The R programming language was first released to the public in 1993 by its creators Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as an implementation of the S programming language with a special focus on statistical computing and graphical modeling. Over the years, R became one of the best programming languages for projects requiring extensive data analysis, graphical data modeling, spatial and time-series analysis. R also provides great extensibility via its functions and extensions that offer a ton of specialized techniques and capabilities to developers. The language also works remarkably well with code from other programming languages, such as C, C++, Python, Java, and .NET.
                <p>Apart from some of the uses mentioned above, R can be used for behavior analysis, data science, and machine learning projects that involve classification, clustering, and more.</p>

        <div class="main-section" id="C">
            <header><H2>C/C++</H2></header>
            <div>
                <p>Believe it or not, the programming languages C/C++ were all the rage in the very late 20th century. Why? It's because C and C++ are both very low-level programming languages, offering blazing fast performance, which is why they were and are still being used to develop operating systems, file systems, and other system-level applications. While C was released in the 70s by Dennis Ritchie, C++, an extension to C with classes and many other additions, such as object-oriented features, was released later by Bjarne Stroustrup in the mid-80s. Even after close to 50 years, both the programming languages are still being used to create rock-steady and some of the fastest applications of all times.</p>
                <p>As C and C++ both offer full access to the underlying hardware, they have been used to create a wide variety of applications and platforms, such as system applications, real-time systems, IoT, embedded systems, games, cloud, containers, and more.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Go, or Golang, is a compiled programming language developed by the search giant Google. Created in 2009, Golang is an effort by the designers at Google to eliminate all the faults in the languages used throughout the organization and by keeping all the best features intact. Golang is fast and has a simple syntax, allowing anyone to pick up the programming language. It also comes with cross-platform support, making it easy and efficient to use. Go claims to offer a mix of high-performance like C/C++, simplicity, and usability like Python, along with efficient concurrency handling like Java.</p>
                <p>Go is primarily used in back-end technologies, cloud services, distributed networks, IoT, but it has also been used to create console utilities, GUI applications, and web applications.</p>
